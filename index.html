            <p>Objective: Match pairs of cards by remembering their positions as fast as you can.</p>
            <p>The game starts with a shuffled deck of matching pairs of cards. Cards are laid face down in a grid pattern on the screen.</p>
            <p>How To Play:
                Once you double click in any card the time will start running. If cards match they will remain opened, otherwise, they will close within 2 seconds
            </p>
            <p>Once you open and match all cards the time will stop, showing how fast you went.</p>
